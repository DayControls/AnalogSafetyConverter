# Analog Safety Converter
This device is designed to be used to monitor 4 normally closed safety switches with a single analog input. 

V2.0 - Designed to read 4 digital inputs (dry contacts) and convert them to an analog 0-5VDC signal.  
V3.0 - Designed to read presence of condensate along with 3 digital inputs (dry contacts).  

V2.0 is much more complete, with wiring diagram and a thorough manual with examples.  See the image of the completed PCB as well as the example of the control logic sequence.  This version has been lab tested with multiple building automation controllers.  
V3.0 is in the prototype phase.  No prototype has been printed yet, but the design is expected to be fully functional as it is.
